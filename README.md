## Planning

### API Aims:

The primary aim of the FitTribe API is to provide a robust and scalable backend service that supports the essential functionalities of a social fitness application. The API is designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users, enabling them to create, share, and interact with fitness-related content. Users can follow each other, post blogs about their fitness journeys, like and comment on posts, and manage their profiles. The API ensures secure authentication and authorization using Django Allauth, ensuring that users' data is protected while offering a personalized and engaging experience.

The FitTribe API encompasses a wide range of features to enhance user engagement and community building. Key features include support for blog posts and workout posts, both of which can be liked and commented on by users. The API also manages user profiles, allowing users to update their personal information and images. Additionally, it supports the creation and management of groups and events, fostering a sense of community among users with shared fitness interests. A dedicated feed feature ensures that users can stay updated with the latest posts from the people they follow, creating a dynamic and interactive experience. By adhering to RESTful principles, the API ensures easy integration with various frontend technologies and the flexibility to accommodate future enhancements as the FitTribe community grows.
